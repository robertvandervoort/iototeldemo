# IoT OpenTelemetry Demo

This project demonstrates sending IoT sensor data to OpenTelemetry using an M5Stack device with ENV III sensor unit.

## Hardware Requirements

- M5Stack Core2 or M5Stack Fire
- ENV III Sensor Unit
- USB-C cable for programming/power

## Software Requirements

- PlatformIO IDE
- Arduino framework
- M5Unified library
- M5Unit-ENV library

## Configuration

Copy `config.h.example` to `config.h` and update with your settings:

```cpp
// WiFi Configuration
#define WIFI_SSID "your_wifi_ssid"
#define WIFI_PASSWORD "your_wifi_password"
#define WIFI_HOSTNAME "m5stack-otel"

// OpenTelemetry Configuration
#define OTEL_HOST "your.otel.host"  // Hostname/IP of your OpenTelemetry collector
#define OTEL_PORT "4318"            // Port for OTLP/HTTP
#define OTEL_PATH "/v1/metrics"     // Path for metrics endpoint
#define OTEL_SERVICE_NAME "m5stack-env"
#define OTEL_SERVICE_VERSION "1.0.0"

// Debug Configuration
#define LCD_SHOW_DEBUG_INFO "1"     // Show debug info on LCD (1=yes, 0=no)
```

## OpenTelemetry Health Check Requirements

This project uses the OpenTelemetry Collector's health check extension to monitor collector availability. The health check endpoint must be properly configured:

### For Splunk OpenTelemetry Collector:
1. The health check extension is included by default
2. You must configure it to listen on an external IP (not just localhost)
3. Add the following to your collector's configuration:

```yaml
extensions:
  health_check:
    endpoint: 0.0.0.0:13133  # Listen on all interfaces
    path: /   # Health check endpoint path

service:
  extensions: [health_check]
  # ... rest of your service configuration ...
```

### For Other OpenTelemetry Collectors:
1. Enable the health check extension in your collector configuration
2. Configure it to listen on an external IP
3. Ensure port 13133 is accessible from your device

The health check endpoint should return a response like:
```json
{"status":"Server available","upSince":"2024-03-24T16:40:45.887236615Z","uptime":"41m39.21715837s"}
```

## Building and Flashing

1. Open the project in PlatformIO
2. Connect your M5Stack device via USB
3. Build and upload the project
4. Monitor the serial output for debugging

## Operation

The device will:
1. Connect to configured WiFi network
2. Initialize the ENV III sensor
3. Begin collecting temperature, humidity, and pressure readings
4. Send metrics to OpenTelemetry collector at configured interval
5. Display current readings and connection status on screen

### Button Controls

- Button A: Cycle through display screens (Main/Network/OpenTelemetry)
- Button B: Reserved for future use

### Display Screens

1. Main Screen
   - Current temperature
   - Current humidity
   - Current pressure
   - Connection status

2. Network Screen
   - WiFi SSID
   - IP Address
   - Signal strength
   - Connection status

3. OpenTelemetry Screen
   - Endpoint details
   - Service name
   - Upload status
   - Last error (if any)

## Metrics

The following metrics are sent to OpenTelemetry:

- Temperature (Â°C)
- Humidity (%)
- Pressure (hPa)
- Battery level (%)
- Battery voltage (V)
- Charging status (0/1)
- WiFi signal strength (dBm)

## Troubleshooting

1. Check serial output for detailed debug information
2. Verify WiFi credentials are correct
3. Ensure OpenTelemetry collector is accessible
4. Check collector logs for any ingestion errors
